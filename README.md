1. How to contribute to other people's open source projects
1. How to use the popular pytest library to ensure that:
    1. You don't break someone else's project
    1. Someone else doesn't break your project

## Instructions

1. You will need a partner to complete this lab,
    so introduce yourself to someone next to you.
    A team of 3 is okay.

1. Create a new repository by clicking the "+" sign in the top right corner.
   
   Ensure the repository is public and that you are not creating any default files in the repo (like a README or LICENSE file).

1. On the lambda server, run the following commands:
    ```
    $ mkdir pytest-example
    $ cd pytest-example
    $ git init
    $ git remote add mikeizbicki https://github.com/mikeizbicki/pytest-example
    ```

1. Update the `README.md` file so that the urls in the test cases badge point to your forked repo
1. Fix the functions in the `Fixme.py` file so that all test cases pass
